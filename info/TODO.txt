[] 1. Declare other tables - not yet

[x] 2. Create the sqlite database - done by hand:

create table orders(id integer primary key, item string, quantity integer, buyer_id string, city string)

# I couldn't get the automatic table creation to wok

[x] 3. Implement methods - show products, edit new-order form, submit order, view orders

[ ] 4. Add users - modifying must login

[x] 5. Bring in flask-bootstrap


[ ] 6. Make the database configurable:

Dev: sqlite
Testing: sqlite
Prod: postgres (or mysql)

[ ] 7. - Add a table for users - select the user in the new order form

btw the model here is that only internal operators are accessing this

At this point we have a monolith working. Now we can work towards microservicing it:

[ ] Replace sqlite with Mysql or postgres

[ ] Break our app into three parts - products, users, and orders

[ ] Submit them as docker containers to a k8s thing and have fun!
